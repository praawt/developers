In Frank's case, it will look like this:\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"name\": \"Frank's apartment\",\n    \"description\": \"Beautiful apartment near city center.\",\n    \"contacts\": {\n      \"general\": {\n        \"email\": \"wt-frank@mailinator.com\",\n        \"phone\": \"+12023581900\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"address\": {\n      \"road\": \"E. Street SW, Suite 5R30\",\n      \"houseNumber\": \"300\",\n      \"city\": \"Washington\",\n      \"state\": \"DC\",\n      \"postcode\": \"20546\",\n      \"countryCode\": \"US\"\n    },\n    \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"defaultCancellationAmount\": 100\n  }\n}\n\nThe defaultCancellationAmount is necessary for handling situations\nwhere the travelers need to cancel their reservation. The value 100\nsimply means that cancellations are not possible and the money cannot\nbe returned.\nInventory\nInventory describes the property itself, in our case, we are offering\nthe apartment as a whole and we do not want more than 3 people there.\n{\n  \"roomTypes\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"franks-apartment\",\n      \"name\": \"Whole apartment\",\n      \"description\": \"This is a whole apartment\",\n      \"totalQuantity\": 1,\n      \"occupancy\": {\n        \"max\": 3\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrices\nPrices are defined as a set of rate plans that can be adjusted and combined\nto individual needs. In this instance, we are happy with a fixed price of\n125 USD per night.\n{\n  \"ratePlans\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"franks-price\",\n      \"name\": \"Fixed price\",\n      \"price\": 125,\n      \"roomTypeIds\": [\n        \"franks-apartment\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nAvailability\nOf course Frank wants to list his apartment only for the weekend when he is\nout of town, so we need to set the availability for those dates. The apartment\nwill be free for three nights - from Thursday to Sunday.\n{\n  \"availability\": {\n    \"roomTypes\": [\n      {\n        \"roomTypeId\": \"franks-apartment\",\n        \"date\": \"2019-07-04\",\n        \"quantity\": 1\n      },\n      {\n        \"roomTypeId\": \"franks-apartment\",\n        \"date\": \"2019-07-05\",\n        \"quantity\": 1\n      },\n      {\n        \"roomTypeId\": \"franks-apartment\",\n        \"date\": \"2019-07-06\",\n        \"quantity\": 1\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nSpecial fields\nIn addition to the aforementioned sections, the data can contain a few\nmore special fields.\nSince we don't currently offer a way of localizing the textual data,\nwe at least allow you to declare in which defaultLocale the content is.\nIt can be used to for example translate the text automatically on the client\nside.\nAnother special field is called booking and contains URI of the\nBooking API instance.\nUploading the data\nThe Write API wants all\nof the data in a single request, so we need to combine everything together.\nNotice that the inventory is actually part of the description section.\nWe will store the data into a file called franks-apartment.json.\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"name\": \"Frank's apartment\",\n    \"description\": \"Beautiful apartment near city center.\",\n    \"contacts\": {\n      \"general\": {\n        \"email\": \"wt-frank@mailinator.com\",\n        \"phone\": \"+12023581900\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"address\": {\n      \"road\": \"E.

InfoLearn how to discover, setup and make discoverable\nthe Winding Tree ecosystem APIs.\n\n\nStep by step\nBooking in Winding Tree ecosystem is done in a decentralized way.\nEvery hotel should advertise a bookingUri in its data published\nthrough Write API. This bookingUri should be pointing to REST\nAPI which is implementing\nthe booking protocol.\nNote: The URI is not the booking endpoint itself. For example,\nthe Booking API is running on https://example.com (that's the bookingUri),\nbut the bookings themselves are supposed to go to https://example.com/booking.\nThe endpoint names are an integral part of the booking protocol.\nIn order to be able to actually book a room, we have to construct\na booking request in the client application. That has to contain\nall of the necessary information so that the hotel can validate and\naccept the booking request.\nCustomer information\nOf course, we have to know who is doing the booking and the hotel has\nto have at least some contact information. The minimal customer information\nmight look like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Elizabeth\",\n  \"surname\": \"Crown\",\n  \"email\": \"elizabeth@example.com\"\n}\n\nBooking information\nThen there's the information about the booking itself. Again, the\nminimal form looks like this:\n{\n  \"arrival\": \"2019-03-01\",\n  \"departure\": \"2019-03-05\",\n  \"guestInfo\": [\n    { \"id\": \"guest-1\" },\n    { \"id\": \"guest-2\" }\n  ],\n  \"rooms\": [\n    { \"id\": \"room-1\", \"guestInfoIds\": [\"guest-1\", \"guest-2\"] }\n  ]\n}\n\nIt might seem unnecessary to pass generic guest id, but it's a format\nthat is easily extensible for more advanced use cases which we support,\nsuch as:\n\nBooking multiple rooms\nAssigning guests to rooms\nTransferring personal information about guests (name, age)\n\nPricing information\nThe final section of a booking request contains the price and all other\nmoney-related information. What might be new to you is the cancellationFees\nfield that contains conditions under which the booking can\nactually be cancelled by the customer. In our example, if a customer cancels\nthe booking at any time prior to the arrival, it will cost him 30% of the price,\nso in this case, the refunded amount will be just about GBP 224.\n{\n  \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n  \"total\": 320,\n  \"cancellationFees\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"2019-02-26\",\n      \"to\": \"2019-03-01\",\n      \"amount\": 30\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nBoth the price and cancellation fees are computed from the data distributed\nvia Winding Tree platform. To compute the data for an actual booking, you can\nuse our open-source Javascript pricing library\n@windingtree/wt-pricing-algorithms.\nOptionally, if you need additional pricing information, you can use the components\nproperty which can contain a day-by-day and guest-by-guest breakdown of the\nprice. It might look like this:\n{\n  \"components\": {\n    \"stay\": [\n      {\n        \"date\": \"2019-03-02\",\n        \"subtotal\": 80,\n        \"guests\": [\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-1\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 50\n          },\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-2\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"date\": \"2019-03-03\",\n        \"subtotal\": 80,\n        \"guests\": [\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-1\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 50\n          },\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-2\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"date\": \"2019-03-04\",\n        \"subtotal\": 80,\n        \"guests\": [\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-1\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 50\n          },\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-2\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"date\": \"2019-03-05\",\n        \"subtotal\": 80,\n        \"guests\": [\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-1\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 50\n          },\n          {\n            \"guestId\": \"guest-2\",\n            \"ratePlanId\": \"early-spring\",\n            \"resultingPrice\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nPutting everything together\nIf we combine everything together, we will get a booking-request.json which in addition\nto everything we've said, contains a hotel's ID (Ethereum address).\n{\n  \"hotelId\": \"0xD8b8aF90986174d5c5558aAC0905AA1DB2Ee41ce\",\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Elizabeth\",\n    \"surname\": \"Crown\",\n    \"email\": \"elizabeth@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"booking\": {\n    \"arrival\": \"2019-03-01\",\n    \"departure\": \"2019-03-05\",\n    \"guestInfo\": [\n      { \"id\": \"guest-1\" },\n      { \"id\": \"guest-2\" }\n    ],\n    \"rooms\": [\n      { \"id\": \"room-1\", \"guestInfoIds\": [\"guest-1\", \"guest-2\"] }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"pricing\": {\n    \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n    \"total\": 320.23,\n    \"cancellationFees\": [\n      {\n        \"from\": \"2019-02-26\",\n        \"to\": \"2019-03-01\",\n        \"amount\": 30\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAnother optional field that you can set is origin which can hold a name\nor identifier of the system where the booking happens - such as a travel\nagency or an online portal.

It serves as a decentralized registry of participating service providers (hotels, airlines) and the tooling is configured to use it.\nThe tooling for the environment consists of one or more REST APIs operated either as a service or on-premise - it typically depends on the necessary security measures. The ecosystem is intentionally open, so you can swap Winding Tree reference implementation and architecture with something completely different that suites your particular use case better.\nActive environments\nWinding Tree team is currently operating several environments.\nWinding Tree is still in an experimental phase and we are currently running two environments for testing. They are usually identical in versions, but they use a separate Winding Tree Index.\nBoth environments are using the Ropsten Ethereum testnet, so you don't need to have real ETH or LÍF to start experimenting with it.\nNotice: Both environments are for technology demonstration purposes only. The production deployment layout is different. Mainly, the Write API is not recommended to be available directly from the internet, because it contains the Ethereum wallet.\nPlayground\n\nIndex: 0xfb562057d613175c850df65e435bb0824b65d319\nRead API: https://playground-api.windingtree.com\nWrite API: https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com\nNotification API: https://playground-notification-api.windingtree.com\nSearch API: https://playground-search-api.windingtree.com\nHotel explorer: https://hotel-explorer-playground.windingtree.com\n\nWe are populating the Playground environment with curated data from wt-fixtures.

Availability data gets updated monthly, so it should make sense at all times.\nNotification API is not deployed for Demo environment, because it is environment agnostic. You can reuse the Playground deployment in case you need it.\nHow to run another environment?\nIf you, for some reason, need to run a fresh and separate environment, the key to do it is to deploy your own Winding Tree Index and run all of the necessary tools with the appropriate configuration.\nHow to reset an existing environment\nSince you are not able to delete any data on behalf of the users, the only way to reset an environment is to deploy a new Winding Tree Index and reconfigure every other tool to point to the new location.\nWhere to next\n\nHow to setup Read API\nHow to setup Write API\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-pick-off-chain-storage.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-pick-off-chain-storage.html","title":"Off-chain adapters for large data","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to pick an appropriate off-chain storage\nIn this tutorial, you will learn about storage options in Winding\nTree ecosystem.\nRequirements\n\nWinding Tree Write API URL. InfoLearn how to discover, setup and make discoverable\nthe Winding Tree ecosystem APIs.\n\n\nStep by step\nWhen you are uploading inventory to Winding Tree ecosystem, you have\nto pick where your data will be stored. This is due to the nature of\nEthereum blockchain, where storing large chunks of data is expensive.\nAnother problem is, that even the smallest change in data results\nin the need of a transaction which might get costly and kind of slow.\nThat's why the majority of data in Winding Tree is stored elsewhere,\nin a so called off-chain storage. And there are multiple options,\nand as it goes each one has its pros and cons.\nAlso, because of the data model designed as a\ntree of documents interlinked by URIs, you are able to combine\nmultiple types of storages: Just pick a different storage for each\ndocument.\nOn the source code level, every storage can be added to Winding Tree\necosystem as an adapter. They are used for both reading and writing\nand are typically plugged into both Write API\nand Read API.\nOn the user level, you have to choose your storage when using the\nWrite API. When you are creating an account, you specify storages\nin the uploaders section. A more detailed description can be\nfound directly in the \nWrite API documentation.\nFor reading, everything should work out of the box and apart from\ntelling the Read API to use all of the adapters, there are no\nadditional steps needed.\nSwarm\nSwarm is a decentralized\nstorage developed alongside Ethereum. It is still in its alpha stage\nand is quite unstable and highly experimental.\nIts main advantage is the decentralization aspect - you don't need to \nmanage your own servers. However, there are quite a few disadvantages:\n\nStill an alpha phase - data can get lost or may become unavailable\nContent hash based addressing - even the smallest change in the data\nmeans that it will get a new address.\n\nAs the documents in the tree are linked with URIs with each other, every\nchange will get propagated upwards and will result into an on-chain\ntransaction.\nSwarm is great for rapid prototyping and testing, but due to its alpha\nnature I wouldn't use it in production just yet. The addressing issue\ncan be mitigated by using Swarm feeds\nwhich we want to support eventually.\nHTTPS\nFor a more robust storage system, we support serving the documents via\ngood old HTTPS. This allows you to even serve the documents dynamically\nfrom your existing backend. You then only need to make sure that your API\nspeaks the proper data format.\nThe biggest disadvantage is that you need to host your data somewhere. The\nWrite API supports upload to AWS S3 out of the\nbox, but the Adapter itself does not contain any HTTPS upload specific code.\nIt is up to you.\nMore options\nThere are of course plenty of options available, some more mature than others.\nIn our older blogpost,\nwe discuss a lot of them and our reasoning for choosing Swarm and HTTPS in more\ndetail.\nIf you'd like to use a so far unsupported storage option, we welcome and third\nparty contribution.

As\nsuch it is holding the Ethereum wallet that is used to manage\nyour primary record in Winding Tree Index.\nRunning the API\nThe recommended way of running Winding Tree ecosystem APIs is via\ndocker images. You can grab the latest stable version of Write API\non Docker Hub.\nFirst, you need to download the docker image:\n$ docker pull windingtree/wt-write-api\n\nAnd then you need to run it with a configuration meant for the\nenvironment you have chosen. You also need to specify to which\nEthereum Node the API will connect. We recommend to register with\nInfura where you will get an HTTP address such\nas https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/project-id which you would use as\nETH_NETWORK_PROVIDER. Be careful to choose the node with appropriate\nnetwork (i. e. ropsten or mainnet).\n$ docker run -p 8080:8000 -e ETH_NETWORK_PROVIDER=address_to_node -e WT_CONFIG=playground windingtree/wt-write-api\n\nThe Write API is then exposed on port 8080:\n$ curl localhost:8080\n{\n   \"config\" : \"playground\",\n   \"dataFormatVersion\" : \"0.4.0\",\n   \"wtIndexAddress\" : \"0xfb562057d613175c850df65e435bb0824b65d319\",\n   \"ethNetwork\" : \"ropsten\",\n   \"info\" : \"https://github.com/windingtree/wt-write-api/blob/master/README.md\",\n   \"version\" : \"0.11.0\",\n   \"docs\" : \"https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/docs/\"\n}\n\nIf you need more control over your setup, you can configure everything with\nenvironment variables passed to docker run command. Detailed documentation\ncan be found in the source code repository.\nSetting up accounts\nWrite API is working with the concept of accounts. Every account\nis a virtual user of the API and has the following properties\nassociated with it:\n\nEthereum wallet that is used to sign and pay for all on-chain transactions\nUploaders configuration that is used when uploading inventory to Winding Tree\necosystem.\n\nWe recommend to associate a particular wallet with only one account and use that\naccount to manage only one record in Winding Tree Index. This recommendation\nis for security and performance reasons.\nAccounts (with associated password protected wallets) are stored in the Write\nAPIs database. So be careful about who can access the API.\nEvery account is represented as a JSON object. We will store this one in a file\ncalled account.json.\n{\n  \"wallet\": {\"version\":3,\"id\":\"7fe84016-4686-4622-97c9-dc7b47f5f5c6\",\"crypto\":{\"ciphertext\":\"ef9dcce915eeb0c4f7aa2bb16b9ae6ce5a4444b4ed8be45d94e6b7fe7f4f9b47\",\"cipherparams\":{\"iv\":\"31b12ef1d308ea1edacc4ab00de80d55\"},\"cipher\":\"aes-128-ctr\",\"kdf\":\"scrypt\",\"kdfparams\":{\"dklen\":32,\"salt\":\"d06ccd5d9c5d75e1a66a81d2076628f5716a3161ca204d92d04a42c057562541\",\"n\":8192,\"r\":8,\"p\":1},\"mac\":\"2c30bc373c19c5b41385b85ffde14b9ea9f0f609c7812a10fdcb0a565034d9db\"}},\n  \"uploaders\": {\n    \"root\": {\n      \"swarm\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe wallet is in a Web3 Secret Storage format\nand is password protected. This one\nrepresents an Ethereum address 0xd037ab9025d43f60a31b32a82e10936f07484246\nand shall never be used for any production operations. Password to this\nwallet is windingtree and we use it accross all of our examples and documentation.\nThe uploaders part tells the Write API where to store the inventory data.\nFor the sake of brevity, we will use Swarm,\na decentralized file hosting. To check for different storage options, take\na look at this tutorial.\nTo create an account with this setup, you need to do the following call:\n$ curl -X POST localhost:8000/accounts \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data @account.json\n\n# accountId and accessKey are generated and will be different every time\n{\"accountId\":\"aa43edaf8266e8f8\",\"accessKey\":\"usgq6tSBW+wDYA/MBF367HnNp4tGKaCTRPy3JHPEqJmFBuxq1sA7UhFOpuV80ngC\"}\n\nAccount usage\nWhen you are calling any endpoint that requires your account, you have to pass\ntwo headers with such request:\n\nX-Access-Key - The value of accessKey returned upon account creation\nX-Wallet-Password - Password that decrypts your Ethereum wallet, in our case windingtree\n\nFor example if you are creating new record\n in Winding Tree Index, you would call:\n$ curl -X POST https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/hotels \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: usgq6tSBW+wDYA/MBF367HnNp4tGKaCTRPy3JHPEqJmFBuxq1sA7UhFOpuV80ngC' \\\n  -H 'X-Wallet-Password: windingtree' \\\n  --data @inventory-data.json\n\nAccount management\nThe accountId value is used only for account management.\nYou can change the uploaders configuration:\n$ curl -X PUT localhost:8000/accounts/aa43edaf8266e8f8 \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: usgq6tSBW+wDYA/MBF367HnNp4tGKaCTRPy3JHPEqJmFBuxq1sA7UhFOpuV80ngC' \\\n  --data @account.json\n\nOr you can delete the account altogether:\n$ curl -X DELETE localhost:8000/accounts/aa43edaf8266e8f8 \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: usgq6tSBW+wDYA/MBF367HnNp4tGKaCTRPy3JHPEqJmFBuxq1sA7UhFOpuV80ngC'\n\nWhere to next\n\nHow to publish inventory\nHow to keep the Write API secure\nHow do I pick an appropriate off-chain storage?\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-setup-aws-s3.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-setup-aws-s3.html","title":"How to setup AWS S3","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to setup AWS S3\nWinding Tree Write API supports\nAWS S3 as an off-chain HTTPS storage out of the box.\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to set it up properly.\nRequirements\n\nWinding Tree Write API URL.

If you are hosting multiple hotels\nin the same bucket, you can specify a path prefix here as well, just change the\n\"arn:aws:s3:::test-hotels/*\" to something like \"arn:aws:s3:::test-hotels/my-fancy-hotel/*\".\nThis will prevent this particular AWS user from touching files that belong to other hotels.\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor1\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObject\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::test-hotels/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nAfter clicking the Review policy button, you will have to name the policy. After that, click \nthe Create policy button.\nIf everything went correctly, you now have an AWS user that can only work with the files in\nthe specific S3 bucket or even subdirectory. That's everything you need to do on AWS.\nCreate an account in the Write API\nThe next step is to actually publish some data into the bucket.

What is probably\na little different is how rich the provided data will have to be\nand how many options of the Winding Tree ecosystem the hotel will\nuse. We will also cover how to update the ever-changing data such\nas prices.\nPreparing the data\nGeneral description\nIn addition to the basics covered in this tutorial,\nyou can add more information to the general description.\nIn the field images, you are able to list URLs leading\nto images describing your hotels which can later be displayed\non the Travel agency website. There is currently no restriction\nas to where to host your pictures, but we recommend to make them\naccessible via HTTP. We also recommend to use HD pictures\nthat look well on modern devices. It should be up to the data\nconsumer to adjust the sizes of these pictures. Also, since there's no\nmetadata available, we recommend to list the most important picture as\nthe first one.\n{\n  \"images\": [\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/ac9ee64f4324f20e89d7ea219954184f357c9a10ba4de4e1d238053d5f86a9b0\",\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/d71ca677b699764d378ebf15851ce7bc0161067b44ca8d628760d88d92870941\",\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/50cbcd7c03d66e0c7be4e76d2e36254494366d7e80d66b9839d588af96a237ff\"\n  ]\n}\n\nWe also offer a way of putting a hotel into certain category for better\nsearch possibilities. Available categories are described in the\ndata model.\nFor legal reasons, it's also a good idea to add information on the hotel's\noperator, a legal entity responsible for running the property.\n{\n  \"operator\": {\n    \"name\": \"Example hotels Ltd.\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"road\": \"E. Street SW\",\n      \"houseNumber\": \"300\",\n      \"city\": \"Washington\",\n      \"state\": \"DC\",\n      \"postcode\": \"20546\",\n      \"countryCode\": \"US\"\n    },\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"email\": \"operator@example-hotel.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou are able to tell a lot more details about your property with\nthe use of amenities, and tags. Eventhough they\nmight look similar, they each have a specific semantics.\nAmenities are yes/no services provided by the hotel and we have an enumeration\nof possible values. Tags are on the other hand totally free and you can\nfill in whatever you'd like.\n{\n  \"amenities\": [\n    \"dry cleaning\", \"free parking\", \"free wi-fi\", \"restaurant\"\n  ],\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"luxury\", \"fine dining\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe most complicated part are the cancellation policies. In any case,\nyou have to specify defaultCancellationAmount which is the cost\nof cancellation in percents of the total price. 0 means everything\nis returned back to the customer, 100 means non-refundable.\nAnything more complicated is optional and you can specify multiple\ncancellation policies that may differ in the following:\n\nWhen are they applicable - for example you may have different policies\nin winter and summer\nHow much time before arrival are they applicable - for example you\nmay return smaller amount the closer you are to the date of arrival. We\ncall this deadline.\n\nThis information is important as a list of cancellation fees is part\nof the Winding Tree's Booking protocol.\nThe following specification means for the traveller that:\n\nIf you cancel between January 1 and June 30\nIf you cancel more than 30 days prior to arrival, you will get back 90%\nIf you cancel between 30 and 5 days prior to arrival, you will get back 75%\nIf you cancel less than 5 days prior to arrival, you will get back 20%\n\n\nIf you cancel any time after July 1\nIf you cancel more than 10 days prior to arrival, you will get back 90%\nIf you cancel less than 10 days prior to arrival, you will get back 10%\n\n\n\n{\n  \"defaultCancellationAmount\": 10,\n  \"cancellationPolicies\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": \"2019-01-01\",\n      \"to\": \"2019-06-30\",\n      \"deadline\": 30,\n      \"amount\": 25\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"2019-01-01\",\n      \"to\": \"2019-06-30\",\n      \"deadline\": 5,\n      \"amount\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"2019-07-01\",\n      \"to\": \"2019-12-31\",\n      \"deadline\": 10,\n      \"amount\": 90\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nInventory\nYou can specify category, images, amenities and tags also for your room types\nin the same way as for the whole hotel.\n{\n  \"category\": \"teepee\",\n  \"images\": [\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/ac9ee64f4324f20e89d7ea219954184f357c9a10ba4de4e1d238053d5f86a9b0\",\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/d71ca677b699764d378ebf15851ce7bc0161067b44ca8d628760d88d92870941\",\n    \"https://swarm.windingtree.com:443/bzz-raw:/50cbcd7c03d66e0c7be4e76d2e36254494366d7e80d66b9839d588af96a237ff\"\n  ],\n  \"amenities\": [\n    \"tv\",\n    \"crib\",\n    \"hairdryer\"\n  ],\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"pink walls\"\n  ]\n}\n\nPrices\nThere are also many more options in pricing design.\nApart from using a single, primary currency on the hotel level,\nyou are able to specify a currency for every rate plan. With\nthis feature, you are able to declare prices in multiple currencies\nas well. Winding Tree at this moment does not provide any conversion\nrates.\nYou can also easily restrict when the rate plan can be applied. You\nhave three options how to do it. You can declare when the rate plan can be used:\n\nbased on the date of the booking (availableForReservation),\nbased on the date of stay (availableForTravel),\nbased on other factors (restrictions, we might add more):\nlength of stay,\nhow many days before the arrival the booking happens (bookingCutOff).\n\n\n\nLast but not least, you can modify the base price of every rate plan when\ncertain conditions (modifiers), such as minimal number of guests, age or length of stay,\nare met. These come in handy for example when a second person\nin the room gets a huge discount. We support the modification either based on percents\nor as an absolute amount.\nThe following example (when added to the required fields of a rate plan) means,\nthat the price is in EUR, can be used for bookings that happen in year 2018 and\nbook rooms for the first half of 2019. If a single person is travelling, she will\npay 100 EUR. If two people are coming, they will also pay 100 EUR (two times\nhalf the price). If three people are coming, they will pay each 50% of base price\nor 150 EUR.\n{\n  \"price\": 100,\n  \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n  \"availableForReservation\": {\n    \"from\": \"2018-01-01\",\n    \"to\": \"2018-12-31\"\n  },\n  \"availableForTravel\": {\n    \"from\": \"2019-01-01\",\n    \"to\": \"2019-06-30\"\n  },\n  \"modifiers\": [\n    {\n      \"adjustment\": -50,\n      \"unit\": \"percentage\",\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"minOccupants\": 2\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nAvailability\nFor availability, you can gain a bit more control with the concept\ncalled restrictions. They basically declare that on certain days,\nit's not possible to arrive or depart.\nThe example is telling the world that it is:\n\nPossible to arrive on December 23\nPossible to depart on December 23\nImpossible to arrive on December 24\nPossible to depart on December 24\nPossible to arrive on December 25\nImpossible to depart on December 25\nPossible to arrive on December 26\nPossible to depart on December 26\n\n[\n  {\n    \"roomTypeId\": \"room-1\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-12-23\",\n    \"quantity\": 4\n  },\n  {\n    \"roomTypeId\": \"room-1\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-12-24\",\n    \"quantity\": 4,\n    \"restrictions\": {\n      \"noArrival\": true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"roomTypeId\": \"room-1\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-12-25\",\n    \"quantity\": 4,\n    \"restrictions\": {\n      \"noDeparture\": true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"roomTypeId\": \"room-1\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-12-26\",\n    \"quantity\": 4\n  },\n]\n\nUploading the data\nThere is no difference in registering your inventory, so in order\nto list your hotel offering, we will call the Write API's /hotels\nendpoint. To be able to do that, you need to have your Write API\naccount ready and configured.\n$ curl -X POST https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/hotels \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: write-api-account-access-key' \\\n  -H 'X-Wallet-Password: ethereum-wallet-password' \\\n  --data @hotel.json\n\nIn the response, you will get an Ethereum address where your hotel\nis registered. That address belongs only to the holder of the used\nEthereum wallet and noone else can modify the record stored there.\n{\"address\":\"0xA603FF7EA9A1B81FB45EF6AeC92A323a88211f40\"}\n\nUpdating the data\nAs your hotel gets some traffic, you will probably become in need\nof updating your inventory, prices or availability.\nIf you are using Write API, you have two options.\nPartial updates\nAs we've shown before, when communicating with Write API the data\nis separated into three sections: description, ratePlans and availability.\nDue to the nature of Winding Tree's ecosystem storage design, you\ncan only update a section as a whole. It is intentionally not possible to\npartially change a single field with a single API call.\nSo, in order to update the price from 100 EUR to 200 EUR, the workflow with\nWrite API looks like this:\n\nPrepare the data into update.json file.\n {\n   \"ratePlans\": [\n     {\n       \"price\": 200,\n       \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n       \"availableForReservation\": {\n         \"from\": \"2018-01-01\",\n         \"to\": \"2018-12-31\"\n       },\n       \"availableForTravel\": {\n         \"from\": \"2019-01-01\",\n         \"to\": \"2019-06-30\"\n       },\n       \"modifiers\": [\n         {\n           \"adjustment\": -50,\n           \"unit\": \"percentage\",\n           \"conditions\": {\n             \"minOccupants\": 2\n           }\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   ]\n }\n\n\nSend a partial update\n $ curl -X PATCH https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/hotels/0xA603FF7EA9A1B81FB45EF6AeC92A323a88211f40 \\\n   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n   -H 'X-Access-Key: write-api-account-access-key' \\\n   -H 'X-Wallet-Password: ethereum-wallet-password' \\\n   --data @update.json\n\n\n\nFull reupload\nIf you for some reason need to change all of the data at the same time,\nyou can. Just use PUT method instead of PATCH.\n$ curl -X PUT https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/hotels/0xA603FF7EA9A1B81FB45EF6AeC92A323a88211f40 \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: write-api-account-access-key' \\\n  -H 'X-Wallet-Password: ethereum-wallet-password' \\\n  --data @all-data.json\n\nWhere to next\n\nPublishing inventory and availability offering for many hotels\nHow to accept bookings?\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-publish-many-hotels.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-publish-many-hotels.html","title":"Publishing bulk inventory for multiple hotels","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to publish bulk inventory for multiple hotels\nDo you manage a system that represents many hotels or properties?\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how you might integrate with\nWinding Tree ecosystem with the existing tooling.\nRequirements\n\nWinding Tree Write API URL. InfoLearn how to discover, setup and make discoverable\nthe Winding Tree ecosystem APIs.\n\nMaintaining data for an entire hotel InfoLearn how to publish inventory for an entire hotel\n\n\nStep by step\nWinding Tree's goal is proper data ownership. That is why every hotel can be\nmanipulated only by the holder of it's owner's Ethereum wallet.\nThere are multiple ways of managing more than one hotel in a single system. We\nwill try to give you some advice and recommendations here for such setup.\nWrite API setup\nWrite API is ready to handle multiple hotels at once. It is also capable\nof working with multiple separate accounts tied to multiple separate \nEthereum wallets.\nWe recommend to set up your system in a way where one Ethereum wallet =\none Write API account = one hotel. This is the most secure and most\nperformant solution. It may be a little bit challenging to distribute ETH\nto all of these wallets but you can for example pre-allocate wallets etc.\nIf multiple hotels would share a wallet, it would mean that they will be\neffectively owned by the same entity. It would also mean that you would not\nbe able to update them simultaneously due to limitations in transaction\nconcurrency on Ethereum.\nIn any case, it would be wise to run Write API on-premise and not expose\nit to the public internet.\nHosting data on your own infrastructure\nThere is quite a big chance that when you are managing many hotels, you\nalready have some system in place, maybe even a public API that your\nconsumer facing applications are using.\nIn order to host the data by yourself, you just need to expose an API\nwhich talks with data that conforms to Winding Tree's\ndata model. In such setup, it of course does not make\nsense to publish all of the data via Write API.\nFor such cases, the Write API offers a shorthand method for registering\nhotels by submitting only the entrypoint URI stored on blockchain. The\ninitial setup is the same as in the ordinary case\n— you need to create an account in Write API.\nHowever, you don't need to specify any uploaders in this case.\n{\n  \"wallet\": {\"version\":3,\"id\":\"7fe84016-4686-4622-97c9-dc7b47f5f5c6\",\"crypto\":{\"ciphertext\":\"ef9dcce915eeb0c4f7aa2bb16b9ae6ce5a4444b4ed8be45d94e6b7fe7f4f9b47\",\"cipherparams\":{\"iv\":\"31b12ef1d308ea1edacc4ab00de80d55\"},\"cipher\":\"aes-128-ctr\",\"kdf\":\"scrypt\",\"kdfparams\":{\"dklen\":32,\"salt\":\"d06ccd5d9c5d75e1a66a81d2076628f5716a3161ca204d92d04a42c057562541\",\"n\":8192,\"r\":8,\"p\":1},\"mac\":\"2c30bc373c19c5b41385b85ffde14b9ea9f0f609c7812a10fdcb0a565034d9db\"}},\n  \"uploaders\": {}\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST localhost:8000/accounts \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data @account.json\n\n# accountId and accessKey are generated and will be different every time\n{\"accountId\":\"aa43edaf8266e8f8\",\"accessKey\":\"usgq6tSBW+wDYA/MBF367HnNp4tGKaCTRPy3JHPEqJmFBuxq1sA7UhFOpuV80ngC\"}\n\nThen, you prepare the data document, which in this case, is much shorter.\nWe will save this file under hotelWithoutData.json. The dataUri value\nshould be pointing to your own service which responds with the data\nentrypoint (Hotel data index)\nfor given hotel.\n{\n  \"dataUri\": \"https://my-custom-api.example.com/hotel-12345\"\n}\n\nAnd then with a simple request with that data, we register the hotel\nin Winding Tree ecosystem.\n$ curl -X POST https://playground-write-api.windingtree.com/hotels \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: write-api-account-access-key' \\\n  -H 'X-Wallet-Password: ethereum-wallet-password' \\\n  --data @hotelWithoutData.json\n\nIn the response, you will get an Ethereum address where your hotel\nis registered.

Optional fields\ninclude a postal address and phone.

It is even ready\nfor allocating guests into particular rooms.\n{\n  \"booking\": {\n    \"arrival\": \"2019-02-03\",\n    \"departure\": \"2019-02-10\",\n    \"guestInfo\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"guest-0\", \"name\": \"Elizabeth\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 25\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"guest-1\", \"name\": \"Philip\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 30\n      }\n    ],\n    \"rooms\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"room-1\",\n        \"guestInfoIds\": [\"guest-0\", \"guest-1\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAnd finally the information about the price that the guest is proposing to the\nhotel. Apart from the total price, this also contains information about\npossible cancellation fees. A hotel can refuse to accept the booking if the\nsubmitted price is just not acceptable.\n{\n  \"pricing\": {\n    \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n    \"total\": 100,\n    \"cancellationFees\": [\n      {\n        \"from\": \"2019-02-01\",\n        \"to\": \"2019-02-03\",\n        \"amount\": 50\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAll of this information combined (also with the appropriate hotelId and an\noptional textual note) will be sent to the appropriate endpoint on the\ndeclared bookingUri.\n{\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Elizabeth\",\n    \"surname\": \"Crown\",\n    \"email\": \"elizabeth@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"booking\": {\n    \"arrival\": \"2019-02-03\",\n    \"departure\": \"2019-02-10\",\n    \"guestInfo\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"guest-0\", \"name\": \"Elizabeth\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 25\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"guest-1\", \"name\": \"Philip\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 30\n      }\n    ],\n    \"rooms\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"room-1\",\n        \"guestInfoIds\": [\"guest-0\", \"guest-1\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"pricing\": {\n    \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n    \"total\": 100,\n    \"cancellationFees\": [\n      {\n        \"from\": \"2019-02-01\",\n        \"to\": \"2019-02-03\",\n        \"amount\": 50\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST https://hotel-booking.com/booking \\\n  -H 'Content-Type': 'application/json' \\\n  --data @booking.json\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"some-booking-reference\",\n  \"status\": \"confirmed\"\n}\n\nThe booking server should of course validate all of the incoming data\nand if the proposed conditions are OK with the hotel, it should accept\nthe booking. It can either make it confirmed or just pending which\nmeans that there might be another process in place.\nSample Booking API\nWe have a sample implementation\nin NodeJS alongside the Booking protocol specification. It is definitely\nnot meant for any production use, but merely as a demonstration of what\nshould be going on in a custom implementation of Booking API.\nIf you already have a Booking system, it should be only a matter of implementing\na data format adapter.\nWhere to next\n\nHow to build a Booking page\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-build-a-booking-page.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-build-a-booking-page.html","title":"How to build a Hotel Booking Page","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to build a Hotel Booking page\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Booking website\nfor a single hotel registered in Winding Tree.\nRequirements\n\nBasic knowledge of HTML and Javascript.\nEthereum address of your selected hotel. InfoLearn how to publish inventory\n\nWinding Tree Read API URL. InfoLearn how to discover, setup and make discoverable\nthe Winding Tree ecosystem APIs.\n\n\nStep by step\nWe will create a single simple HTML page with four parts:\n\nGeneral description\nInventory\nPriced offer\nBooking form\n\nInitial setup\nHere's a boilerplate HTML where we will put all of the other code:\n\n\n  \n    \n    Winding Tree simple sample booking page\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Select a room\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nGetting the hotel data\nTo make things easy, we will get all of the data in a single GET request.\nThis is not the most optimal way, but it will make this tutorial shorter. In a\nreal-life application, you would probably load the data about availability and\nprices only when needed. We are also not loading everything, because we want to\nkeep the page as simple as possible.\n\n  (() =>{\n    const errorDiv = document.getElementById('error');\n    const wtReadApi = 'https://playground-api.windingtree.com';\n    const hotelId = '0xD8b8aF90986174d5c5558aAC0905AA1DB2Ee41ce';\n    const fields = [\n      'name',\n      'address',\n      'currency',\n      'cancellationPolicies',\n      'defaultCancellationAmount',\n      'bookingUri',\n      'roomTypes.id',\n      'roomTypes.name',\n      'roomTypes.occupancy',\n      'availability',\n      'ratePlans',\n    ];\n    const displayHotelData = (hotelData) => {\n      console.log(hotelData);\n    }\n    fetch(`${wtReadApi}/hotels/${hotelId}?fields=${fields.join(',')}`)\n      .then((response) => {\n        if (response.status > 299) {\n          throw new Error('Bad server response.');\n        }\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(displayHotelData)\n      .catch((err) => {\n        errorDiv.innerHTML = err.toString();\n      })\n  })();\n\n\nAfter adding this code to the script section and refreshing the page in \nyour browser, you should see hotel data in the browser's console. Of course,\nyou can change the hotelId and wtReadApi variables to work with different hotel\nin a different Winding Tree environment.\nWe would of course like to show the hotel information to the visitor, so let's do\nexactly that.\nconst displayHotelData = (hotelData) => {\n  const address = `\n    ${hotelData.address.road} ${hotelData.address.houseNumber},\n    ${hotelData.address.city} ${hotelData.address.postcode}\n    ${hotelData.address.countryCode}\n  `;\n  document.getElementById('hotel-name').innerHTML = hotelData.name;\n  document.getElementById('hotel-address').innerHTML = address;\n  const roomTypesSelect = document.getElementById('room-types-select');\n  hotelData.roomTypes.map((rt) => {\n    roomTypesSelect.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `\n      ${rt.name}\n    `);\n  });\n};\n\nAfter this step, you should see the hotel data in the page itself!\n\nChecking availability and getting a price\nNow, this part is tricky! To simplify things a little bit, we will\nconsider this to be a personal booking page made for a lovely couple,\nlet's call them Elizabeth and Philip.\nIn order to be able to determine availability and price of a particular \nroom type, we will use our open-source Javascript pricing library\n@windingtree/wt-pricing-algorithms\nwhich we can easily load from unpkg.\n\n\nThis will make it available under window.wtPricingAlgorithms. Make sure to place\nit before our existing Javascript script tag.\nNow, to check availability and compute a price, we need certain informations\nregarding the travellers:\n\nDate of arrival\nDate of departure\nList of guests - the prices can be based on number of guests and their age\n\nAs said before, to make things a little easier, we will have a list of\nguests hardcoded:\nconst guests = [\n  {\"name\": \"Elizabeth\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 25},\n  {\"name\": \"Philip\", \"surname\": \"Crown\", \"age\": 30},\n];\n\nAnd for the dates, we will add two user inputs.\n\n  Date of arrival\n  \n\n\n  Date of departure\n  \n\n\nNow we have to put the pricing library to a good use. We will\ndo the price computation every time any of the input values change.\nWe will also use a dayjs library\nto smoothly work with various possible date formats used around the\nworld.\nconst roomTypesSelect = document.getElementById('room-types-select');\nconst arrivalDateInput = document.getElementById('arrival-date');\nconst departureDateInput = document.getElementById('departure-date');\nconst recomputePriceAndAvailability = () => {\n  const roomType = roomTypesSelect.value;\n  const arrival = dayjs(arrivalDateInput.value);\n  const departure = dayjs(departureDateInput.value);\n  // Basic validation\n  if (!roomType ||\n      !arrival.isValid() ||\n      !departure.isValid() ||\n      departure.isBefore(arrival) ||\n      arrival.isBefore(dayjs())\n    ) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const pc = new window.wtPricingAlgorithms.prices.PriceComputer(\n    hotelDataFromApi.roomTypes,\n    hotelDataFromApi.ratePlans,\n    hotelDataFromApi.currency\n  );\n  const resultingPrice = pc.getBestPrice(\n    new Date(), // Booking date\n    arrival,\n    departure,\n    guests,\n    hotelDataFromApi.currency,\n    roomType\n  )\n    // We might not get a price - room is meant for a different number of people or pricing data is not available\n    .filter((p) => p.id === roomType && p.prices.length);\n  if (resultingPrice.length) {\n    // Different price resolution strategies might return more than one price\n    const actualPrice = resultingPrice[0].prices[0];\n    document.getElementById('offer-price').innerHTML = `Price ${actualPrice.total.format()} ${actualPrice.currency}`;\n  } else {\n    document.getElementById('offer-price').innerHTML = 'Price unavailable';\n  }\n}\nroomTypesSelect.addEventListener('change', recomputePriceAndAvailability);\narrivalDateInput.addEventListener('change', recomputePriceAndAvailability);\ndepartureDateInput.addEventListener('change', recomputePriceAndAvailability);\n\nIf we are lucky, we will get a price. But what about the availability? Well,\nlet's add it to the part where we come up with the price.\nconst indexedAvailability = window.wtPricingAlgorithms.availability.indexAvailability(hotelDataFromApi.availability.roomTypes);\nconst roomAvailability = window.wtPricingAlgorithms.availability.computeAvailability(\n  arrival,\n  departure,\n  guests.length,\n  hotelDataFromApi.roomTypes,\n  indexedAvailability\n).filter((ra) => ra.roomTypeId === roomType && ra.quantity);\nif (roomAvailability.length) {\n  const actualQuantity = roomAvailability[0].quantity;\n  document.getElementById('offer-quantity').innerHTML = `Available: ${actualQuantity}`;\n} else {\n  // Room might be sold out, unavailable for arrival or departure on given dates etc.\n  document.getElementById('offer-quantity').innerHTML = 'Unavailable';\n}\n\nAfter this last step in this section, the website should look like on the\nscreenshot below. You can play around with it to see that the data gets\nrecomputed every time the values change.\n\nSending a booking to the hotel\nNow we are almost able to call the Booking API.\nBut if we check the API documentation,\nit's obvious that we are still missing a few pieces of information.\nFirst, we need a book button\nBook a room!\n\nthat gets activated when the room is available and we know for how much.\nif (resultingPrice.length && roomAvailability.length) {\n  bookButton.removeAttribute('disabled');\n}\n\nSo what should happen after the button is clicked? We have to assemble\nall data required for the Booking API. Let's deal with that one by one.\nFirst are information on the customer. Since we consider this to be a private\npage, we can hardcode them in.\nbookButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  const customer = {\n    name: 'Elizabeth',\n    surname: 'Crown',\n    email: 'elizabeth@example.com',\n  };\n});\n\nThe booking information needs to be slightly adjusted from what we already\nhave.\nconst booking = {\n  arrival: dayjs(arrivalDateInput.value).format('YYYY-MM-DD'),\n  departure: dayjs(departureDateInput.value).format('YYYY-MM-DD'),\n  guestInfo: guests.map((g, i) => Object.assign({id: `guest-${i}`}, g)),\n  rooms: [\n    {\n      id: roomTypesSelect.value,\n      guestInfoIds: ['guest-0', 'guest-1']\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nThe only thing we have not yet encountered are cancellationFees in the\npricing section. They contain conditions under which the booking can\nactually be cancelled by the customer. Luckily, the pricing library can\ncompute them for us. All we have to do is ask.\nconst actualPrice = resultingPrice[0].prices[0];\nconst pricing = {\n  currency: actualPrice.currency,\n  total: actualPrice.total.value,\n  cancellationFees: window.wtPricingAlgorithms.cancellationFees.computeCancellationFees(\n    new Date(),\n    dayjs(arrivalDateInput.value),\n    hotelDataFromApi.cancellationPolicies,\n    hotelDataFromApi.defaultCancellationAmount\n  )\n};\n\nBy combining everything together, we will end up with the booking request\nwhich we can send to the Booking API instance declared by the hotel itself.\nfetch(`${hotelDataFromApi.bookingUri}/booking`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    customer: customer,\n    hotelId: hotelId,\n    booking: booking,\n    pricing: pricing,\n  }),\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n.then((response) => {\n  if (response.status > 299) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot save booking!');\n  }\n  return response.json();\n})\n.then((data) => {\n  errorDiv.innerHTML = `Your booking was accepted with the state ${data.status} under ID ${data.id}`;\n})\n.catch((err) => {\n  errorDiv.innerHTML = err.toString();\n});\n\n\nAnd that's it - you can see that the majority of heavy-lifting is done\nby existing tools and libraries and all we had to do is to work with the \ndata in the browser.\nWhere to next\n\nFull code of this example\nHow to build a Travel Agency\n\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nFAQ\n\nHow much does it cost to publish Inventory\nHow do I generate my own Ethereum wallet\nHow do I get  the first Ether (ETH)\nHow do I keep the Write API secure\n\n"},"tutorials/how-much-does-it-cost.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-much-does-it-cost.html","title":"How much does it cost to publish Inventory","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow much does it cost to publish Inventory?\nIn this tutorial, you will learn about transaction costs on Ethereum\nand how big are they in Winding Tree ecosystem.\nRequirements\n\nEthereum wallet with ETH Info\nHow do I generate Ethereum wallet?\nHow do I get my first Ether?\n\n\n\nStep by step\nYou pay certain amount of ETH for every Ethereum transaction. In order\nto use Winding Tree ecosystem, you need to create a transaction at two\npossible occasions - registering and updating an inventory.\nTransaction cost in Ethereum is based directly on how much computational\npower your transaction needs and how much data it is storing on the\nnetwork. For every operation there is a fee specified in the\nEthereum Yellow Paper\n(Appendix G).\nEvery time you post a transaction, you tell Ethereum what's the maximum\namount of gas you are willing to spend (gas limit) and how much ETH you are\nwilling to pay for a unit of gas (gas price). This determines how much\nETH a miner will get for that transaction when they process it.\nAlthough the total amount of gas that a transaction needs is\ndeterministic, it may differ between Ethereum networks due to experiments\nand slight variations. After all, testnet is for testing.\nAnother factor coming into play is the gas price. As it directly influences\nhow much ETH the miners will get, the transactions that will reward more ETH\nusually get mined first. This can spiral up the gas price when the network is\noverloaded. On the other hand, during times with low traffic, you can get away\nwith minimal gas price.\nAs such, all numbers here are purely orientational. It heavily depends on\ncurrent state of the network, current exchange rate of ETH to fiat currencies,\ncurrent implementation of Winding Tree Index and amount of data you are storing.\nNotice: Ether has many sub-units, just like USD has cents. One of them is\nGwei and is usually used when talking about gas prices. 1 Ether consists of\na billion Gweis, i. e. 1 Ether = 1,000,000,000 Gwei (109).\nRegistering new inventory\nFrom experience, registering a hotel\non Ropsten network costs around 575000 gas. Depending on the network load, it\nmay be anywhere between 0.0143758 (gas price 25 Gwei) and 0.000575 ETH\n(gas price 1 Gwei).\nDepending on the ETH to USD rate, it might be anywhere between 16 USD\n(based on average price from January 2018)\nand USD 0.06 (average based on price from January 2019).\nUpdating an existing inventory\nYou need to update the inventory essentially only when something stored\non-chain changes which in the right setup should be virtually never.\nBut from experience, updating a hotel\non Ropsten network costs around 52000 gas. Depending on the network load, it\nmay be anywhere between 0.0013008 (gas price 25 Gwei) and 0.000052 ETH\n(gas price 1 Gwei).\nDepending on the ETH to USD rate, it might be anywhere between 1.46 USD\n(based on average price from January 2018)\nand USD 0.006 (average based on price from January 2019).\nWhere to next\n\nWhat is Ethereum Gas: Step-By-Step Guide (blockgeeks.com)\nWhat is current status of gas on Ethereum mainnet?

This address is sometimes\ncalled Ethereum wallet. A single person can own many addresses at\nonce. And behind some addresses there aren't even people, but computer code.\nHow do I own a wallet?\nEvery address is derived from a thing called private key\nand anyone who has access to this private key is in control of the wallet.\nNever share your private key! If you do, you are risking losing your\nfunds. It is like sharing a password. You should never do that.\nWhen you are in control of a wallet, you can perform (technically correct\nterm is sign) transactions with it. Transactions tell Ethereum to do something,\nthe usual operation is to transfer Ether (ETH) or\nanother ERC-20 token.\nEvery transaction also costs gas which is paid in ETH and the amount\nspent depends on how complex your transaction is. For example registering\na hotel in Widing Tree platform will be more expensive than transferring\nETH from one wallet to another.\n\nWhy do I need a wallet?\nWinding Tree's core entity is deployed to Ethereum blockchain. It is\ncalled Winding Tree Index and it's a registry of hotels, airlines and\nother ecosystem participants.\nIn order to register your property to Winding Tree index, you need to perform\na transaction on Ethereum and that is why you need a wallet with some ETH\nin it. You will also need your wallet to modify the record in Winding Tree\nindex.\nThe important thing to know is, that only the owner of the record can\nwork with it. That means that only the owner of the wallet can work with the\nrecord. So don't throw your wallet away, it's your key to working with\nyour data in Winding Tree ecosystem.\nHow to create a new wallet?\nThere are many options of how to create a new wallet. Some\nmore secure than others.\n\nSince Winding Tree ecosystem is using wallets in the\nWeb3 Secret Storage\nformat, we will show you how to get that one.\nAs we said before, you should never share a private key, so\nnever generate a wallet in an online service. Use a trusted\nsoftware that is running locally and does not expose your secrets.\nOne of such tools is MyCrypto which\nallows you to generate a Keystore file.\nA Keystore file is a JSON file that contains\na private key encrypted by a unique passphrase. If you forget your\npassphrase or lose your Keystore file, you will lose access to\nyour wallet. So be careful.\nUpon starting MyCrypto, you can select Create new wallet in the\nleft menu. Then you select Generate wallet and finally a Keystore\nfile. You will put in your passphrase which encrypts the Keystore file\nand then you can download the file itself. It will look like this:\n{\n  \"version\": 3,\n  \"id\": \"7fe84016-4686-4622-97c9-dc7b47f5f5c6\",\n  \"address\": \"d037ab9025d43f60a31b32a82e10936f07484246\",\n  \"crypto\": {\n    \"ciphertext\": \"ef9dcce915eeb0c4f7aa2bb16b9ae6ce5a4444b4ed8be45d94e6b7fe7f4f9b47\",\n    \"cipherparams\": {\n      \"iv\": \"31b12ef1d308ea1edacc4ab00de80d55\"\n    },\n    \"cipher\": \"aes-128-ctr\",\n    \"kdf\": \"scrypt\",\n    \"kdfparams\": {\n      \"dklen\": 32,\n      \"salt\": \"d06ccd5d9c5d75e1a66a81d2076628f5716a3161ca204d92d04a42c057562541\",\n      \"n\": 8192,\n      \"r\": 8,\n      \"p\": 1\n    },\n    \"mac\": \"2c30bc373c19c5b41385b85ffde14b9ea9f0f609c7812a10fdcb0a565034d9db\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn addition to the Keystore file, you can save and even print your private key. That's\nan equivalent to the Keystore file and password combination. Protect it with the same\ncare.\nThis JSON file can directly be used when creating an account in Write API.\nWithout ETH associated with this wallet, however, you are not yet able to\ncreate transactions in the Ethereum network.\nWhere to next\n\nHow do I buy my first Ether?\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-get-first-ether.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-get-first-ether.html","title":"How do I get  the first Ether (ETH)","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to get first Ether\nIn this tutorial, you will learn about Ether (ETH) and how to get it.\nIn addition, you will learn about ERC-20 tokens, such as LÍF.\nRequirements\n\nEthereum wallet InfoHow do I generate Ethereum wallet?\n\n\nStep by step\nEther (ETH) is a cryptotoken native to Ethereum. All transaction costs\nare paid for with it. ETH comes to the world as a reward for those who\nparticipate in processing new transactions in the network (so called\nminers).\nFaucets\nApart from that, in testing networks (or testnets) of Ethereum, you\ncan get free ETH from special addresses that are called faucets.\nETH is not transferrable between networks, so ETH you get from a faucet\non a testnet cannot be used in the production network (or mainnet).\nThere are multiple testnets, but we will stick to the one called Ropsten.\nSome of the faucets are:\n\nhttps://faucet.ropsten.be/ \nhttps://faucet.metamask.io/ (Requires MetaMask browser extension)\nhttps://faucet.kyber.network/ (Requires login through GitHub)\n\nAfter you put in your wallet address (such as 0xd037ab9025d43f60a31b32a82e10936f07484246),\nthe faucet should send you free Ether. To verify that it actually\nhappened, you can check transactions associated with your wallet\nin a block explorer, such as Etherscan for Ropsten.\nJust put your address in the search input in the upper right corner.\nMainnet\nIn the main Ethereum network, there are no faucets. From time to\ntime you can get paid in ETH for something, but there are two\nmain ways how to get ETH.\nMining\nMining is a term used for participating in processign transactions in\nthe network. If you want to take part in mining, you will run a node\n(associated with an Ethereum wallet) that tries to be the first to\ncome up with the next network block. If the node succeeds in that\neffort, it is rewarded with ETH.\nNowadays, mining for a standalone separate node does not make\nmuch economical sense. \nExchanges\nVery common way of getting ETH is through exchanges. There\nare some where you can buy ETH with USD or EUR (commonly referred\nto as fiat currencies). And there are some where you can get\nETH in exchange to other cryptotokens.\nIt's up to you which exchange you choose, but you should pick one\nthat is well-established, secure and allows you to withdraw your ETH\nfunds at any time to a wallet that is not controlled by the exchange.\n\nERC-20 tokens\nERC-20 compatible token is\na cryptotoken of its own that is built on, operates on and is traded\non Ethereum network. It is not equal with ETH, for example you are\nnot able to pay for transaction costs with them.\nTher are plenty of ERC-20 tokens, Winding Tree's\nLÍF being one of them. Similarly to ETH,\nyou can buy them on exchanges, but there are many models how the tokens\ncan be distributed.\nTypical ERC-20 token is tied to a specific use-case or a specific\napplication.\nWhere to next\n\nHow to publish Inventory\n\n"},"tutorials/how-to-secure-write-api.html":{"url":"tutorials/how-to-secure-write-api.html","title":"How do I keep the Write API secure","keywords":"","body":"\nLast modified: Thu Apr 18 2019 08:29:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n\nHow to keep the Write API secure\nIn this tutorial, you will learn a few security tips\nregarding Winding Tree Write API\nand wallet management.\nRequirements\n\nEthereum wallet InfoHow do I generate Ethereum wallet?\n\n\nStep by step\nEthereum's best practice is to sign every transaction locally,\nin a way that your private key never leaves your computer.\nBut in an environment where you need to issue many transactions,\nit is just not feasible to sign everything by hand.\nAnother best practice is to protect the private key by a passphrase.\nThat's exactly what the wallet in a\nWeb3 Secret Storage format\nenables us. But this wallet file has to inevitably be stored in\na software, in our case Write API.\nAnd it is also inevitable that you have to decrypt the wallet\nfile to extract the private key when you need to sign a transaction.\nThe Write API design tries to at least decouple the wallet\nand the passphrase as much as possible. That's why you\nhave to provide your wallet passphrase with every request. The\nprivate keys are only exposed in-memory for the shortest time possible.\nHere are some more tips on how to make your Write API instance\nas secure as possible.\nNetwork isolation\nSince the Write API stores an Ethereum wallet for every account\nand it can possibly hold dozens or hundreds of accounts and\ntherefore wallets, it can easily become an attacker's target.\nBy design, an attacker can try to crack the passphrases totally\noffline with as much computing power as she can.\nThat is why we recommend to run the Write API in a secure\nisolated network and prevent access to it from the public\ninternet.\nFunds\nBecause you can never be sure that your wallets from Write\nAPI are totally safe, you should take an extra measure and\nkeep the amount of ETH in them limited only to cover the\nnecessary costs.\nIf you hold large amounts of ETH, you should never make\nthem available in a wallet stored in any software.\nThat is why we recommend to keep the ETH funds assigned\nto each wallet to a bare minimum.\n\nData isolation\nWrite API allows you to control many records in Winding Tree\nIndex under a single Ethereum wallet. That means that\nsuch wallet is an owner of all of the records in Winding Tree\nIndex and if it gets compromised, an attacker will get control\nof all of these records.\nIt is a best practice to have every record managed by a different\nEthereum wallet. This also brings you performance gains as it \nwill allow you to publish changes for multiple records to the \nsame Ethereum block.\nThat is why we recommend to associate a particular wallet\nwith only one Write API account and use that account to manage only\none record in Winding Tree Index.\nWhere to next\n\nHow to setup Winding Tree Write API?\n\n"}}}
